Hello young wizard, 
Welcome to The Enchanted Forest!

Look around. A centaur may give you a quest.  There are many fairies here to help you on your journey. But watch out for trolls, they will 
try to catch you! And the goblins...they always tell the truth, but they should not be trusted.

To navigate the forest, you will need these three magical items:

ls
cat
cd

To look around you, use: ls
It gives you a LiSt of whats around you.

The things you see are either files (things you can print) or directories (rooms you can step into and look around in).
Files usually have a file extension, like ".txt" at the end of their name. Directories usually do not have any extension.

To print the contents of a file, use: cat <file>
example: cat README

To move into a directory, use: cd <directory>
example 1: cd the_enchanted_forest
example 2: cd kings_land

Good Luck!
