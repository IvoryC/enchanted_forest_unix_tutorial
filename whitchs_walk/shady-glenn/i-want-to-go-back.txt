Jumpy Fairy

Back? but you just got here!
If you go, do you promise to come back?

Yes, "back", that's just what you want.
Tell me, where were you before you were here?
Right before the last time you used cd ?
The cd is powerful, it remembers even if you don't.
Use this:
cd -

That will take you "back".  Once you get there, where was the last place you were before there?
-->HERE of course!!!
Use `cd -` to go back, and then use it again to COME back here.
For some practice, try bouncing between that shodowy area and the sunny area, just over there.
