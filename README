README

Welcome to The Enchanted Forest!

Use the cd command to move into a directory.
Use the ls command to look around where you are now.

Most directories have a README, like me. Always read the REAMDE!
Use the cat command to print file contents to the screen.
Some of my cousins use different file extensions, like README.md, README.txt; but just plain "README" is enough for me.  You get 
the message, right? READ ME! (got it?)
