Want to go fast like me?

Don't bother typing out the full name of a file or directory, the first letter or two is enough. Then hit "tab" and I'll fill in the rest 
for you.

Try it out:
cat ta
--and tab, and I'll fill in the rest! Then you hit enter.

I can fill in anything that you can see with ls, you just have to type enough that I know which file or directory you want.
I can even run ahead of you and see things before you do!

Try it out:
cd th
--and tab! I'll give ya to the_castle, and --tab again, I'll show you wants there.  
Add JUST enough, "th" --tab! and I'll take you all the way to the throne-room.
You and me, we can tab through loads of directories in flash! tab! tab! tab!
