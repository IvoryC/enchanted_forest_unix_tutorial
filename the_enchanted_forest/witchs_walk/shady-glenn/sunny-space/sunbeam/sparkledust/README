README

Fun fact: git will not store an empty directory.

Its against its code.
But there are work-arounds.

Like this!
Give the folder a README file.

But then the directory isn't really empty, is it?

Can you find any truely empty directories in the forest?
Look in --all around inside if you think you do. ;)
