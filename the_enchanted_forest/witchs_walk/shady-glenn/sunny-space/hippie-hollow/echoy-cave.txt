===echo===
-enchanted creature
-helful
-harmless

You see cave say "hello"
It says "hello" back.
You play with the echo for a while.

The echo enjoys playing with you so much, that it leaves the cave to follow you on your journey.
You can play with it any time, like this:

echo "I'm a butterfly"

And the echo prints "I'm a butterfly" to the screen.

Because this is an enchanted creature, it is very helpful in the forest.
It can see the environment variables.  
It sees them for what they are; not just what they are called.

Like this:

echo $PATH

It can even see the name of the environemnt itself:
echo $0
