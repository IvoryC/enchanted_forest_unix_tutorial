The environment is full of little strings called variables.
They are all around us, even if you can't see them.

One environmenbt variable you can count is $PWD. It is magically updated everytime you cd.
Its a string that holds the path to your current working directory (where you are).
Just like what you see when use the `pwd`.

To see it, try:
echo $PWD

Not familiar with echo? check out that echoy cave over there...

See the sign at the beginning? The dah-lar sign. 
That's how echo knows you are calling a variable.
You wizards can see the sign, but you can't see the value.

There are so many more!
Some are always here, but some come and go. 

To see which ones are in the environment right now, use this: 
printenv

See? See? They are real!
With printenv, you see the name and the value attahced with a special binding sign, the e-kwal.

I see one called "USER" and I see its value, that looks like you!
Did you miss it in the list?
To see just that one, just ask echo:
echo $USER

And there you are!

You've unlocked a new power: printenv

This power is not used often...  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
