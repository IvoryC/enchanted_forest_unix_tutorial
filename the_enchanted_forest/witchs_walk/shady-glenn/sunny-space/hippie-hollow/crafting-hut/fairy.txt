Did you know, you can CREATE environment variables?
Use the e-kwal binding.
Like this:
NAME=Crystal

Then tell echo to find it for you using the dah-lar sign.
echo $NAME

But take note, your variable is not shown with printenv.
Your variable is not privided by the system.
It was created in the current session, so it only lasts as long as this session. 
If you close your terminal it will be gone forever.

But thats nice! You wouldn't want to clutter up the environment forever!
You can variables for what you want to store right now, and when you're done, so are they.

Try creating a variable for my address.
HUT=$PWD

check it with echo:
echo $HUT

When you are far away, you can come back here using:
cd $HUT

...but only for today.  When the sun sets on this session, 
the $HUT variable will fade out of existance.

You CAN make variables that last accross sessions, 
but that's for another day.
